[no-access]
Power sensing was requested, but you lack access authority
to the required path on this node:

  Node: %s
  Path: %s

We will continue to operate, but will not monitor power.
[no-sockets]
Power sensing was requested, but your topology doesn't
identify sockets and we are therefore unable to verify
the processor type as supported.

We will continue to operate, but will not monitor power.
[unsupported-model]
Power sensing was requested, but your processor type
is not currently supported.

  Detected model: %d

We will continue to operate, but will not monitor power.
[no-topo-info]
Power sensing was requested, but the topology info
required to verify processor-level support was not
available. This usually means that your system lacks
the required revision level for hwloc.

We will continue to operate, but will not monitor power.
#
[no-cores-found]
Power monitoring was requested, but this node
does not appear to have the required core-level files,
or you lack access authority to them:

  Node:  %s

We will continue to operate, but will not monitor power.
